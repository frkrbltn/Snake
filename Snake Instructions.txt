5. The game should start running,

Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the snake in four directions (up,down,left & right)
around the screen. 

The goal of Snake is to eat the most apples(the red circle) until the game ends. 

The game ends when the snake comes in contact with the borders of the game window
or when the snake comes in contact with itself.

The challenge of the game is that once an apple is eaten, the snake grows longer,
making it harder to maneuver the snake around the board without hitting the borders
or itself.
